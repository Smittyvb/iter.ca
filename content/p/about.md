I'm interested in programming and technology. This is my personal website. I have done lots of things that I find interesting; see [my homepage](/) for a comprehensive list. I also document [some of the things I use](/p/uses/) to do my computing. Some of the things I am particularly interested in are:

- The [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which is a programming language with very different design desicisons from most other mainstream languages. I have made some contributions to `rustc`, the reference compiler (and presently the only complete one).
- Free/open-source smartphones, such as the [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/), which are phones that can run software that is almost entirely FOSS. I find it really cool being able to use my phone as though it were any other device I can SSH into, and being able to send and recieve texts and phone calls from the command line is really cool, albeit not very useful.
- Stochastic time tracking, which is a time tracking system that randomly samples what one is doing. I am the author of [TagTime Web](https://ttw.smitop.com/), which is FOSS web-based software that does exactly this, and is quite featureful.
- The color cyan, it is my favourite color.

Feel free to contact me by emailing {{< email >}}, or one of the [many other ways](/p/accounts/) to contact me.
