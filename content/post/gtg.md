I've tried and failed to use many productivity systems.

<!--
digraph "Productivity" {
    "Find new productivity system" -> "Enjoy novelty of new system"
    "Enjoy novelty of new system" -> "Use new productivity system a lot"
    "Use new productivity system a lot" -> "My life feels pretty organized"
    "My life feels pretty organized" -> "Novelty wears off"
    "Novelty wears off" -> "Get bored of productivity system"
    "Get bored of productivity system" -> "Stop using productivity system"
    "Stop using productivity system" -> "Find new productivity system"

- have tried many productivity apps
- eventually landed on GTG
- foss
- plugins
- works well for simple usage
- start/due dates
- nested tasks work well

---

- how I use it
- pruning old tasks
- keeping it fairly fresh
- no time scheduiling
