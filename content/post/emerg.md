There are many systems that allow for the distribution of emergency alerts.
In Canada, the marketing name for the emergency alert system is [*Alert Ready*](https://www.alertready.ca/).
There's [a seperate website with the actual technical details](https://alerts.pelmorex.com/), which refers to the system as the "National Alert Aggregation & Dissemination System", or NAADS.
That website has a lot of technical information about the operation of the system -- you should check it out if you're interested.
The system isn't run by the government directly, but contracted out to [Pelmorex](https://www.pelmorex.com/en/), which operates it on behalf of the government of Canada.
