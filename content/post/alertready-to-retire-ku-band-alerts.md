+++
Pelmorex Inc., the company that runs Canada's national emergency alerts system, AlertReady, has announced that they will stop broadcasting emergency alerts on the Ku satellite band.

Alert distributors will still be able to receive alerts through other methods, including C band satellite communication, a RSS feed, an Internet-based stream, and via an alert archive.

In an email to alert broadcasters, Pelmorex said that they were retiring the band due to Ku band signals "being used by very few LMDs (mainly as a backup connection)". They will stop broadcasting on August 31, 2019.
