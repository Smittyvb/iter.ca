All of these are syntax sugar for a `core` trait (such as [`Add`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/ops/trait.Add.html) or [`Index`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/ops/trait.Index.html)) but are typically invoked using their syntax sugar, and are implemented with compiler magic (code generation is handled differently than normal by the compiler):\r\n\r\n- `+`/`-`/`*`/`>>`/`<<` panic on overflow in debug mode\r\n- dividing by zero or modulusing zero (`x / 0` or `x % 0`)\r\n- for signed integer types, `i*::MIN / -1` and `i*::MIN % -1` always panics, **even in release mode**\r\n- for signed integer types, `-i*::MIN` \r\n- performing an out of bounds array index into a slice/array/str\r\n\r\nThe [no_panic](https://docs.rs/no-panic/latest/no_panic/) crate can be used to statically verify that a function will never panic. There are a few catches to be aware of when using this crate ‚Äî be sure to read the documentation first.","Verbose":1},

The reason that such a blanket implementation doesn't exist is because it's not technically possible. Just adding a `impl<T: Ord> PartialOrd for T` block to `core` would result in an error:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nerror[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `std::cmp::PartialOrd<&_>` for type `&_`\r\n --> src/lib.rs:1:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | impl<T: Ord> PartialOrd for T {\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: conflicting implementation in crate `core`:\r\n          - impl<A, B> PartialOrd<&B> for &A\r\n            where A: PartialOrd<B>, A: ?Sized, B: ?Sized;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is already a blanket implementation in `core` that implements `PartialOrd` for all references to `PartialOrd` types. By implementing `PartialOrd` for *all* types that implement `Ord`, it would be possible to have `PartialOrd` implemented for the same type twice. It would then be unclear which implementation should be used. Consider this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]\r\nstruct X;\r\nimpl PartialOrd for X {\r\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {\r\n        panic!(\"1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nimpl Ord for &X {\r\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {\r\n        panic!(\"2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the traits that get implemented on `X`\r\n\r\n- `X: PartialOrd` (directly implemented), panics with `1`\r\n- `&X: PartialOrd` (blanket implementation for references), panics with `1`\r\n- `&X: Ord` (directly implemented), panics with `2`\r\n\r\nBut if we were to implement `PartialOrd` automatically, then there would be an additional implementation of `PartialOrd` on `&X` that panics with `2`. It is ambiguous how it should be resolved.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is to use specialization, which is an unstable feature in Rust, that didn't even exist when Rust 1.0 was released. As such, not implementing `PartialOrd` was the only option. Specialization allows the same item to have multiple conflicting trait implementations in a way that is unambiguous, but it is currently unstable, unsound, and nightly only.

Specifically, `lock` makes the instruction be executed atomically. [Intel's x86 manual](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf) specifies what instructions support the `lock` prefix. Bitwise `not` supports the `lock` prefix\r\n> This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.\r\n\r\nSo if there's an x86 instruction for it, why isn't there an atomic operation for it? [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) doesn't have an intrinsic for it. In Rust, the `Atomic*` functions all forward directly to an LLVM intrinsic, so only the operations that had a corresponding LLVM intrinsic got a function. The memory model for JavaScript atomics [\"takes significant inspiration from LLVM\"](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem/blob/5acab4636ead3cc9fe13b0d97a40c7dadab2fed9/LLVM_LIKE.md), so it doesn't seem like a stretch to guess that the `Atomics` functions were just copied from what LLVM had.\r\n\r\n[LLVM supports 6 intrinsic operations](https://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html#libcalls-atomic): `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, and `nand`. It supports those ones because [GCC has intrinsic operations with the same names](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/LIbrary#line-238) (except for the type). Atomic `and`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, and `xor` operations [were added to GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2011-August/320670.html) ([`nand` was added later](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2011-September/323038.html)) as a part of adding support for `std::atomic` in C++11.\r\n\r\nC++11 has 5 bitwise atomic operations in `std::atomic`: add, sub, and, or, xor. (but not nand, which gets an intrinsic in GCC but no actual support in `std::atomic`). Why? Because that is what was suggested in the [2007 paper](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2324.html) originally proposing atomics in C++, which defines the operations \"fetch-and-{add,sub,and,or,xor}\". They don't provide a reason for only having those 5 operations, but my guess is that they wanted to minimise the amount of implementation work for compiler implementors, since you can get a NOT operation by XORing against all ones. Or maybe they just didn't think about it.","Verbose":1},

It turns out all Rust programs have an implict dependency on either `core` or `std` though (although you can avoid this with the unstable `#![no_core]`, but good luck actually getting anything to compile that way), so you probably want to get the bitcode for that too.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do that is to compile the standard library from source to bitcode. [`cargo` has experimental support for building the standard libraries from source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std), so just append `-Z build-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (and update the target if needed) to your `cargo` build command. When using `--target`, which is required by `-Z build-std`, the build files are put in a target-specific directory, `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/` in this case. The targetless directory contains build-dependencies for the standard libraries: we don't want that!\r\n\r\nWe don't want to link *all* of the standard libraries. We really only need `std` and its dependencies: `proc_macro` isn't needed here since we are compiling to a binary, not a proc-macro. We also need to link with either `proc_abort` or `panic_unwind`, matching it up with the unwind codegen setting we chose. The default is unwinding, so let's delete the other one, `proc_abort`. Let's send those libraries to the chopping block: `rm target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/{panic_abort,proc_macro}-*.bc`.\r\n\r\nLet's try linking for real this time:\r\n```lang-bash\r\nrm -r target/\r\nRUSTFLAGS=\"--emit=llvm-bc\" cargo build --release -Z build-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrm target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/{panic_abort,proc_macro}-*.bc\r\nllvm-link target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/*.bc > withalldeps.bc\r\n```\r\n\r\nYay, it worked!

The standard library also depends on `libpthread` and [`dlsym`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym) which are language-asnostic libraries/functions that are usually implemented in C. You can use `clang` and a `libc` implementation that supports being compiled with Clang (GNU libc doesn't, I think musl might work here?) to get that if needed.

You might want to consider just calling the linker manually.\r\n\r\nFirst, [dump the JSON target metadata](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/custom.html) (using a nightly compiler) for the target you are compiling *to*, replacing `[target]` with a target triple like `thumbv7neon-unknown-linux-musleabihf`:\r\n```bash\r\n$ rustc -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json --target [target] > target.json\r\n```\r\n`target.json` now has target-specific compilation information. On some targets (such as WASM), EH frame headers are disabled by default. If you see a line like this in `target.json`, you are already done (and shouldn't be getting that error):\r\n```json\r\n  \"eh-frame-header\": false,\r\n```\r\nIf you don't see that line, then add it to `target.json` right after opening brace, like\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"eh-frame-header\": false,\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\nYou can now specify the path to `target.json` wherever a target triple would normally be. However, you now need to recompile the standard libraries (such as `core` and `std`) with the new target information. Otherwise, the compiler will tell you that ``the `target-17676080659170949227` target may not be installed``. On unstable Cargo, you can use `-Z build-std`\r\n to do that:\r\n```bash\r\n$ cargo +nightly run -Z build-std=core --target target.json\r\n```\r\nIt will take a bit longer than normal, since it needs to recompile the `core` standard library. Not all platforms support compiling the fuller `std` library this way, but you can change the `build-std=core` to just `build-std` if you want to try to build the whole `std` standard library as well.","Verbose":1},

It is an [attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/attributes.html). Rust doesn't have a complete specification, but the `repr` attribute [is mentioned in the Rust reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/type-layout.html#representations), so it is absolutely a part of the language. Implementation-wise, attributes are parsed the same way all other Rust code is, and are stored in the same AST. Rust has no \"attribute pass\": attributes are an actual part of the language. If someone else were to implement a Rust compiler, they would need to implement `#[repr(C)]`. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, `#[repr(C)]` *can't* be implemented without some compiler magic. In the absence of a `#[repr(...)]`, Rust compilers are free to arrange the fields of a `struct`/`enum` however they want to (and they do take advantage of this for optimization purposes!).\r\n\r\nRust does have a good reason for using it's own memory layout. If compilers aren't tied to how a `struct` is written in the source code, they [can do optimisations like](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/repr-rust.html) not storing `struct` fields that are never read from, reordering fields for better performance, `enum` tag pooling<sup>2</sup>, and using spare bits throughout [`NonZero*`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/num/index.html)s in the struct to store data (the last one isn't happening yet, but might in the future). But the main reason is that Rust has things that just don't make sense in C. For instance, Rust has zero-sized types (like `()` and `[i8; 0]`) [which can't exist in C](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9723093/14004262), `trait` vtables, `enum`s with fields, generic types, all of which cause problems when trying to translate them to C.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Okay, you could use the C preprocessor with Rust if you really wanted to. Please don't.\r\n\r\n<sup>2</sup> For example, `enum Food { Apple, Pizza(Topping) } enum Topping { Pineapple, Mushroom, Garlic }` can be stored in just 1 byte since there are only 4 possible `Food` values that can be created.","Verbose":1},

The air is cold, and the stone walls are a dismal grey. You can see Sparkles beyond the gate,\r\n>     trapped once again. Sparkles sees you, and rushes towards the gate. The gate, however, holds firm.\r\n> </p>\r\n> <p>On the wall next to the gate is an alphanumeric keypad with a small note taped to it. You're concerned for a moment that someone wrote the access code on the note. That'd be very > poor security!\r\n>     But no, thankfully it just says <code>/##¬£</code>.</p>\r\n> <p>In front of you is a pressure plate, and a large leather knapsack sitting atop it. The bag is empty. You push the bag to the side, and stand on\r\n>     the plate. Glowing letters appear in the surface of the obsidian wall. They read:</p>\r\n>\r\n> <div class=\"d-flex fs-subheading fd-column gsy gs8 flex__center my32 fw-bold\">\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> **SURELY A COMPUTER COULD NEVER SOLVE SUCH A PROBLEM.**\r\n>\r\n> **THE WEIGHT‚ÄôS THE KEY, YOU SEE.**\r\n>\r\n> **AND COMPUTERS WEIGH NOTHING.**\r\n>\r\n> </div>\r\n>\r\n> <p>Seven stones fall from the ceiling around you, crashing into the floor below. You narrowly dodge these stones, and the dust takes a moment to settle.</p>\r\n>\r\n> <p>Once the dust clears, you can see that the stones vary in their weights and sizes. On each stone is printed a set of letters. Each stone also fills the\r\n>     bag a specific amount. Thinking quickly, you pull your notepad out, and form the following table:</p>\r\n>\r\n> |% of bag filled|Text on the stone|\r\n> |-|-|\r\n> |12%|ONTMCR|\r\n> |18%|MLRKAP|\r\n> |27%|EDJCSH|\r\n> |32%|LKQJZO|\r\n> |54%|CBHAQF|\r\n> |74%|UTZSIX|\r\n> |86%|QPVOET|\r\n\r\n### The proper way to solve this\r\n\r\nAll of the texts on the stones are the word `POUNDS` with different amount of letter rotations:\r\n\r\n% of bag filled | Text on the stone|Offset|Unscrambled|\r\n----------------|------------------|------|-----------|\r\n12%             | ONTMCR           |2     |POUNDS\r\n18%             | MLRKAP           |3     |POUNDS\r\n27%             | EDJCSH           |11    |POUNDS\r\n32%             | LKQJZO           |4     |POUNDS\r\n54%             | CBHAQF           |13    |POUNDS\r\n74%             | UTZSIX           |21    |POUNDS\r\n86%             | QPVOET           |25    |POUNDS\r\n\r\nThe offset value is treated as the weight of the stone in pounds for this puzzle.\r\n\r\nHere's what we need to figure out: we need to fill up our knapsack with stones to make it as heavy as possible, keeping in mind that we can't overfill the bag. This is a form of [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\r\n\r\nThe optimal solution is to put the 2 pound and 25 pound stones in our bag. Combined they take up 98% of our bag and weigh 27 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle text says that we need to enter a code into \"an **alphanumeric** keypad\", so we know the next URL to go to is all digits. Since the sticky note says `/##¬£` (¬£ is the currency symbol for British pounds), we know to get to `/27` next.\r\n\r\n### The cheaty way to solve this\r\n\r\nJust try all numbers from 0-100.

It wouldn't accomplish much, since the sites aren't very private anyways ‚Äî anyone can see the content on a private beta site by creating an account.\r\n\r\n## License grant\r\n\r\nNote that that the quote in your question isn't from the license itself, but the human-readable summary, which is not a substitute for the license.

The \"restrictions\" disallowed in those section are referring to *Effective Technological Measures*, not non-public distribution: essentially, it *would* disallow you from modifying SE content and then sharing it (publicly or privately) but using [DRM (digital restrictions management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) to try to prevent people from resharing your modified version. But assuming you don't use DRM to restrict access to your redistributed SE content (I can't imagine why you would want to do that), those sections aren't relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/bO9m3.png","Verbose":1},

Here, we get an enciphered hint:\r\n\r\n\r\n>UIF VOJDPSO IBT CFFO LJEOBQQFE!\r\n>\r\n> XIFSF JT UIF EFGFOEFS PG UIF VOJDPSO OPX?!?!\r\n>\r\n> <strike>TUBZ UVOFE‚Ä¶</strike> XBJU, B DMVF IBT CFFO MFGU:\r\n>\r\n> > NFFU NF BU `/tbwf-tqbslmft`\r\n>\r\n> OPX XIBUFWFS DBO UIBU NFBO?\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly simple cipher: just subtract one from each letter. So `z` goes to `y`, `y` goes to `x`. `a` loops around to `z`.

Let's decode the kidnapper's notes. This cipher is not a simple Caesar cipher, but it does seem to be a sort of substitution code.\r\n\r\nThe cipher used here was familiar to me because, *\\*sigh\\**, the cipher used here is very similar to the way certain models of Cisco Wi-Fi routers attempt to obfuscate their configuration. They used to just have it in plaintext, but then someone found some security issues with the way config files are handled, so Cisco just obfuscated the contents of the config file a little bit.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what's happening here is that each letter in the messages has been replaced with another letter uniformly. For example, all `w`s have been replaced with `x`s. We can easily find most of the mappings with a known-plaintext attack. Remember that haiku from a section ago? Some of the text in the the second note matches up to that. Compare:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nrj xjfaf, rj xjfaf jbt\r\npz nicorai hrif? rj xjfaf\r\nrj xjfaf obi tjf df? \r\n```\r\n\r\n```none\r\noh where, oh where has\r\nmy unicorn gone? oh where\r\noh where can she be\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this, we can learn what most of the letters are. We see that from the first word, `o` maps to `r`, `h` maps to `j`, and so on. Here's what we can decode so far (decoded text is in **bold**):\r\n\r\n<pre><b>n</b><b>o</b><b> </b><b>e</b>s<b>u</b><b>i</b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b> </b>w<b>i</b><b>c</b>v<b>i</b><b>m</b><b>\r\n</b><b>e</b>w<b>e</b><b>r</b><b> </b><b>r</b><b>a</b><b>n</b>e<b>o</b><b>m</b>m<b>y</b><b> </b><b>g</b><b>a</b>w<b>e</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b>\r\n</b><b>n</b><b>o</b><b>i</b><b>s</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b>i</b><b>g</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>b</b><b>o</b><b>u</b>v<b> </b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>r</b><b>e</b>w<b>o</b>m<b>u</b>v<b>i</b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b>i</b>u<b>e</b>e<b>\r\n</b><b>u</b><b>n</b>v<b>i</b>m<b> </b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b>e</b>em<b>e</b><b>s</b><b>s</b>m<b>y</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>r</b><b>r</b><b>a</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b>e</b>e<b>\r\n</b><b>r</b><b>e</b>w<b>e</b><b>r</b><b>s</b><b>e</b>e<b> </b><b>o</b><b>n</b>v<b>o</b><b> </b><b>u</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>n</b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b> </b>e<b>o</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b> </b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b>e</b>eg<b>u</b>m<b>\r\n</b>e<b>e</b>g<b>y</b><b> </b>e<b>o</b><b>w</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>e</b><b>a</b><b>c</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>s</b><b>e</b><b>c</b><b>r</b><b>e</b>v<b> </b><b>e</b><b>a</b><b>r</b><b>\r\n</b><b>r</b><b>u</b><b>n</b><b> </b>v<b>i</b>m<b> </b><b>y</b><b>o</b><b>u</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>u</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b>c</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>u</b>q<b>o</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>i</b><b>n</b>v<b> </b><b>b</b><b>a</b><b>s</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>m</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b>r</b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b>,</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>i</b>m<b>e</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b> </b>q<b>o</b><b>n</b>e<b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b>e<b>,</b><b> </b>g<b>u</b>mm<b> </b><b>o</b>g<b> </b><b>s</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b>r</b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b>\r\n</b><b>o</b>w<b>e</b><b>r</b><b> </b><b>e</b><b>n</b>em<b>e</b><b>s</b><b>s</b><b> </b>e<b>b</b><b> </b><b>r</b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b>c</b><b>o</b><b>r</b>e<b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b> </b><b>s</b>v<b>a</b>v<b>s</b><b> </b><b>o</b>g<b> </b><b>g</b><b>a</b><b>m</b><b>e</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>g</b><b>a</b>m<b>o</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b> </b>‚Äî<b>\r\n</b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>i</b>m<b>e</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b> </b>v<b>r</b><b>i</b><b>e</b>e<b>,</b><b> </b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b>a</b><b>r</b>m<b>y</b><b> </b><b>s</b><b>u</b><b>c</b><b>c</b><b>e</b><b>e</b>e<b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b>,</b><b> </b>v<b>o</b><b> </b>q<b>r</b><b>e</b>w<b>e</b><b>n</b>v<b> </b>v<b>h</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>m</b><b>o</b><b>u</b><b>n</b>e<b>s</b><b> </b><b>o</b>g<b> </b><b>c</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>a</b>v<b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b>\r\n</b><b>s</b><b>u</b>ee<b>e</b><b>n</b>m<b>y</b><b> </b>v<b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>a</b><b>m</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b> </b>w<b>i</b><b>s</b><b>i</b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b>,</b><b> </b>q<b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>m</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>h</b><b>a</b>v<b>r</b><b>o</b><b>o</b><b>m</b><b> </b>e<b>o</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b> </b>‚Äî<b>\r\n</b>‚Äú<b>w</b><b>h</b><b>a</b>v<b> </b><b>c</b><b>o</b><b>u</b>me<b> </b>v<b>h</b><b>a</b>v<b> </b><b>b</b><b>e</b><b>,</b>‚Äù<b> </b><b>i</b><b> </b><b>m</b><b>u</b>vv<b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b>e<b>,</b><b> </b>‚Äú<b>b</b>m<b>i</b><b>n</b>l<b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>m</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>h</b><b>a</b>v<b>r</b><b>o</b><b>o</b><b>m</b><b> </b>e<b>o</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b> </b>‚Äî<b>\r\n</b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>n</b>m<b>y</b><b> </b>v<b>h</b><b>i</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>n</b>e<b> </b><b>n</b><b>o</b>v<b>h</b><b>i</b><b>n</b><b>g</b><b> </b><b>m</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b>e</b>.‚Äù<b> </b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>o</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b>,</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>h</b><b>a</b><b>s</b><b>\r\n</b><b>m</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>u</b><b>n</b><b>i</b><b>c</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>g</b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b>e</b><b>?</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b>\r\n</b><b>o</b><b>h</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>a</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>b</b><b>e</b><b>?</b><b> </b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>\r\n</b>q<b>r</b><b>o</b><b>c</b><b>e</b><b>e</b>e<b> </b>v<b>o</b><b> </b>/_____-_____-___-______-___-______-___/3463333</pre>\r\n\r\nAt this point, let's look at what the underlined letters form: `ne?er-gonna-run-aroun?-an?-?eser?-you`\r\n\r\nIt's pretty easy to guess that it's going to form `never-gonna-run-around-and-desert-you` for seasoned Rick Ashley enthusiasts, but for those who don't know so much about the lyrics of hit pop songs, we can make some easy inferences about letters: for example, with <code><b>abou</b>v</code>, it's pretty easy to guess that `v`s should be replaced with `t`s.

When getting lists of posts through the Stack Exchange API, which has various methods to obtain lists of posts that contain both questions and answers, and sorting by the `creation` date, the ordering is inconsistent.

The ordering appears to depend on some internal database state.\r\n\r\nFor instance, [this listing of my posts][2] sometimes returns [the question][3] first, and sometimes returns [the answer first][4].

Normal: question is oldest, answer is newer][5]][5]\r\n\r\nInstead of this current behaviour, the question should always be before the answer.

[Here are the scripts I used to get those numbers](https://github.com/Smittyvb/so21ele).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, here are the votes in the OpaVote file missing from the SO file (this is a bit complicated to get since the SO file has 1 vote per line but the OpaVote one lumps identical votes together):\r\n```\r\n1 1 0          # Zoe\r\n1 6 2 4 5 1 0  # Dharman, Ryan M, Daniel Widdis, Stephen Rauch, Zoe\r\n1 1 2 6 4 5 0  # Zoe, Ryan M, Dharman, Daniel Widdis, Stephen Rauch\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happened to these three votes in the SO file?

It would effect military operations, but the executive branch already has the power to decide military strategy (the King is the commander-in-chief of the military, he delegated those powers to the governor general, and the governor general by convention only acts on the advice of the Cabinet). \r\n\r\nNote that unlike many other countries (such as the US), the Canadian constitution is mostly silent on the topic of international treaties, only mentioning treaties agreed to by the UK on behalf of Canada (at the time the constitution was written, Canada couldn't agree to treaties itself), so there are no constitutional requirements for the legislative branch to approve any treaties.\r\n\r\nAlso note that treaty implementing legislation is almost always passed, since the executive branch needs to maintain the support of a majority of the legislature. If the legislature doesn't pass implementing legislation, then the legislature would also be very likely to pass a no-confidence motion, which would usually trigger a new election.","Verbose":1},
{"Type":"SePost","Id":"se-law-78886","Title":"Why are legal fees not unconstitutional where equal protection clauses exist?","Uri":"https://law.stackexchange.com/a/78886/29055","Date":{"Unix":1648337533},"Text":"People *have* argued that such legal fees are unconstitutional. Court fees that are a \"obstacle that prevents some people from benefitting from the law as much as other people\" [*have* been found unconstitutional](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc59/2014scc59.html) by the Supreme Court of Canada in [Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia v. British Columbia (Attorney General)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc59/2014scc59.html). Instead of the equal protection clause, [section 96 of the *Constitution Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-3.html#h-25) is the basis on which these court fees are disallowed:\r\n\r\n> The Governor General shall appoint the Judges of the Superior, District, and County Courts in each Province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThis clause (along with 92(14), which grants provincial governments jurisdiction over \"the Administration of Justice in the Province\") has been interpreted as prohibiting provincial or federal governments from enacting laws that that remove jurisdiction from the superiour courts. It \"confers a special and inalienable status on what have come to be called the ‚Äòsection 96 courts‚Äô\".\r\n\r\nParagraph 22 answers your question:\r\n> It was argued that all hearing fees are unconstitutional; as courts are a ‚Äúfirst charge on government‚Äù, charging fees for time in court is as offensive to democracy as charging fees for voting.  However, this argument is flawed because it focuses on the type of the fee, rather than the real problem ‚Äï using fees to deny certain people access to the courts.  Moreover, the argument raises policy issues relating to how governments should generate revenue and allocate their funds.  Hearing fees paid by litigants who can afford them may be a justifiable way of making resources available for the justice system and increasing access to justice overall.\r\n\r\nAnd (para. 35-36):\r\n\r\n> Here, the legislation at issue bars access to the superior courts in yet another way ‚Äï by imposing hearing fees that prevent some individuals from having their private and public law disputes resolved by the courts of superior jurisdiction ‚Äï the hallmark of what superior courts exist to do. As in MacMillan Bloedel, a segment of society is effectively denied the ability to bring their matter before the superior court.\r\n>\r\n> It follows that the province‚Äôs power to impose hearing fees cannot deny people the right to have their disputes resolved in the superior courts.  To do so would be to impermissibly impinge on s. 96 of the *Constitution Act, 1867*.  Rather, the province‚Äôs powers under s. 92(14) must be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the right of individuals to bring their cases to the superior courts and have them resolved there.\r\n\r\nThe reasons go into more detail as to what specifically made hearing fees in question deny access to the superior courts.\r\n\r\nThe reasons don't mention the equal protection clause, but it doesn't seem like the equal protection clause would also make some court fees unconstitutional. By your interpretation of the equal protection clause, *all* administrative fees would be unconstitutional. The Canadian constitution also grants fairly broad powers to the federal and provincial governments to raise taxes. The federal government can take part in \"the raising of Money by any Mode or System of Taxation\", and provinces can \"Direct Taxation within the Province in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial Purposes\". Court fees are a form of raising money for the government, so it doesn't seem that the equal protection clause would be applicable here. (But it's kinda moot since the use of court fees to make the courts unavailable for people with less money is already unconstitutional).\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that if you can't afford the relevant court fees, you can get them waived.","Verbose":1},
